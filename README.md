# A Hybrid Approach to Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Using Supervised Learning Methods

## About
This project aims to improve network security by developing a new method for detecting unusual activity in network traffic. 
We use a combination of hybrid supervised learning techniques (knn, random forest) to make our detection system more accurate and efficient. 
By training our system on labeled data and using algorithms like KNN and random forest, we can better classify network traffic as normal or suspicious.
Our system is also adaptable to changing network conditions, making it suitable for use in large-scale networks. 
Overall, our goal is to make a model for network security stronger by enhancing anomaly detection capabilities.


## Requirements
### Software Requirements:

- Operating System: Linux-based distribution preferred for its compatibility with network analysis tools and libraries.</br>
- Network Traffic Capture Tools: Software tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic data.</br>
- Machine Learning Libraries: Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for implementing supervised learning algorithms.</br>
- Data Processing Tools: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization.</br>
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Such as Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm for coding and experimentation.</br>

## Results and Impact
Implementing an anomaly detection system using a hybrid supervised learning approach can lead to several positive outcomes and impacts:

- Better Detection Accuracy: The system can more accurately spot unusual activities in network traffic, reducing errors in identifying potential threats.</br>
- Improved Security: By quickly identifying and addressing suspicious behavior, the system helps prevent cyber attacks and protects sensitive data.</br>
- Faster Response: Real-time monitoring means problems are identified promptly, allowing for quicker responses to prevent or minimize damage from security incidents.</br>
- Efficient Operations: Automated detection frees up time for network administrators to focus on other tasks, improving overall efficiency.</br>
- Insightful Reports: The system generates reports and visualizations that provide valuable insights into network activities, helping organizations make informed decisions.</br>
- Compliance and Trust: Meeting regulatory requirements and demonstrating a strong commitment to security builds trust with customers and stakeholders.</br>
- Continuous Improvement: The system can adapt and improve over time, staying effective against new threats and changes in network conditions.</br>

In simple terms, implementing this system means better security, faster problem-solving, and smarter decision-making to keep networks safe and running smoothly.
